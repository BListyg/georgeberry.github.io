Before coming to Cornell, I studied English at Oberlin College, and then worked with economist [Eugene White](http://econweb.rutgers.edu/ewhite/) for a year studying banking panics. At Cornell, I've broadened my research interests and frequently work across disciplines. I spent the last two summers interning at Facebook on the Core Data Science team, working primarily with [Sean Taylor](http://seanjtaylor.com/). I have in-progress work with [Chris Cameron](http://chrisjcameron.github.io/) and [Alex Peysakhovich](http://alexpeys.github.io/).\r\n\r\nI will be joining Facebook's [Core Data Science](https://research.facebook.com/datascience/) (methods team) team starting in Fall 2017.\r\n\r\n### Research interests\r\n\r\nI study influence processes and properties of social structure using computational techniques. These techniques include machine learning, natural language processing, causal inference, digital experimentation, and simulation. I view a main part of my work as adapting and advancing these methods for sociological research.\r\n\r\nSubstantively, I am interested in how influence processes operate in public spaces online, in patterns of online association, and in the role social structure plays in bridging the micro-macro divide. There is a continuum in my work: influence processes operate at the individual level, while social structure constrains how these individual processes may coalesce into a whole.\r\n\r\n### Fellow travelers\r\n\r\nI am fortunate to study alongside talented people: [Antonio Sirianni](http://www.soc.cornell.edu/people/gradstudents/), [Tom Davidson](https://t-davidson.github.io/), [Wei Dong](http://infosci.cornell.edu/forward-thinking-people/phds/wei-dong), [Minsu Park](http://infosci.cornell.edu/forward-thinking-people/phds/minsu-park), and [Rediet Abebe](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/).\r\n\r\n### Open source\r\n\r\nOpen source and code sharing are important to me, both as a matter of principle and for replicability of studies. You can check [my github](https://github.com/georgberry) or the [Social Dynamics Lab github](https://github.com/socdyn) to see stuff. I wrote the first version of Blaunet, an [open-source R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Blaunet/index.html) for computing social distance measures. New work on this package is done by [Cheng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uj_a8oIAAAAJ&hl=en). In addition, I have contributed to the NLTK package, along with sharing some silly code to [send a tweet](https://github.com/georgeberry/your-code-tweets) when your Python code fails.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\nI'm an avid reader and video gamer. When I'm not reading sociological tomes, I like science fiction and contemporary short-form writing. You can also find me playing simulation games and imagining how the simulation model could be made more realistic.",
