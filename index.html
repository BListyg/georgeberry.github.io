<p>I study sociology at Cornell University. I'm in my 5th year, and advised by Michael Macy. Before coming to Cornell, I studied English at Oberlin College, and then worked with economist Eugene White for a year studying banking panics. At Cornell, I've broadened my research interests and frequently work across disciplines. I spent the last two summers interning at Facebook on the Core Data Science team (economic research in 2015, and methods in 2016). I will be joining the Data Science team starting in Fall 2017.</p>

<p>I study influence processes and properties of social structure using computational techniques. These techniques include machine learning, natural language processing, causal inference, digital experimentation, and simulation. I view a main part of my work as adapting and advancing these methods for sociological research.</p>

<p>Substantively, I am interested in how influence processes operate in public spaces online, in patterns of online association, and in the role social structure plays in bridging the micro-macro divide. There is a continuum in my work: influence processes operate at the individual level, while social structure constrains how these individual processes may coalesce into a whole.</p>
