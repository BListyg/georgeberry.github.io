### Bio

I study sociology at Cornell University. I'm in my 5th year, and advised by Michael Macy. Before coming to Cornell, I studied English at Oberlin College, and then worked with economist Eugene White for a year studying banking panics. At Cornell, I've broadened my research interests and frequently work across disciplines. I spent the last two summers interning at Facebook on the Core Data Science team, working primarily with Sean Taylor. I have in-progress work with Chris Cameron, Alex Peysakhovich, and Ana Franco.

I will be joining Facebook's Core Data Science (methods) team starting in Fall 2017.

### Research interests

I study influence processes and properties of social structure using computational techniques. These techniques include machine learning, natural language processing, causal inference, digital experimentation, and simulation. I view a main part of my work as adapting and advancing these methods for sociological research.

Substantively, I am interested in how influence processes operate in public spaces online, in patterns of online association, and in the role social structure plays in bridging the micro-macro divide. There is a continuum in my work: influence processes operate at the individual level, while social structure constrains how these individual processes may coalesce into a whole.

### Fellow travelers

I am fortunate to work and study alongside talented people: Antonio Sirianni, Tom Davidson, Wei Dong, Minsu Park, Milena Tsvetkova, Patrick Park, Yongren Shi, Mario Molina, Min Yi, and Rediet Abebe.

### Open source

Open source and code sharing are important to me, both as a matter of principle and for replicability of studies. You can check my github or the Social Dynamics Lab github to see some of the stuff I've worked on. I wrote the first version of Blaunet, an open-source R package for computing social distance measures. New work on this package is done by Cheng Wang. In addition, I have contributed to the NLTK package, along with a doing a really simple poll analysis, and sharing some silly code to send a tweet when your Python code fails.

### Misc

I'm an avid reader and video gamer. When I'm not reading sociological tomes, I like science fiction and contemporary short-form writing. You can also find me playing simulation games and imagining how the simulation model could be made more realistic.
